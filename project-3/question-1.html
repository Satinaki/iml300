             <h3>Importance of sovereignty:</h3>
            <p>"Without sovereignty, the indigenous population of the United States would merely be a cultural group with no further status or protection, and the various states and the federal government would have no obligation to recognize the needs or wants of the tribal nations." -- Southeastern Oklahoma State University</p>
            <p> Being a dependent/not having the land allocated to them results in the federal government lacking to uphold their needs: </p>
            <p style = "font-style: italic">"As of 2011, there were over 120,000 tribal homes lacking access to basic water sanitation services." --

            <P>When you turn on the news, there is always never positive depictions of unhoused people. There has always been sentiments of dehumanization toward them which the media has reflected and consequently propagated. Therefore, it is no surprise that there are cruel policies determining where they can and can't go â€” even on public land. </P>
