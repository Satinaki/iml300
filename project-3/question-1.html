            <p style="font-style:italic">"LANDBACK is literal reclamation of land. We want access to our lands. We want to be able to embody our original instructions to be the caretakers of this land. That's not in a colonial context in terms of the way people think about ownership of the land. It's more about returning to the land because the way that we're taught in our ceremonies and our teachings tell us is that, we are the land and we belong to the land, not the other way around."</p>

             <h3>Importance of sovereignty:</h3>
            <p style="font-style:italic">"Without sovereignty, the indigenous population of the United States would merely be a cultural group with no further status or protection, and the various states and the federal government would have no obligation to recognize the needs or wants of the tribal nations." -- Southeastern Oklahoma State University</p>
            <p> Being a dependent/not having the land allocated to them results in the federal government lacking to uphold their needs: </p>
            <p style = "font-style: italic">"As of 2011, there were over 120,000 tribal homes lacking access to basic water sanitation services." --
                United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012</p>

            <p>"Representation is important, it's critical, but it's not the destination, and now we continue to organize at the grassroots level around those issues that are of concern." -- Judith LeBlanc</p>

            <P>When you turn on the news, there is always never positive depictions of unhoused people. There has always been sentiments of dehumanization toward them which the media has reflected and consequently propagated. Therefore, it is no surprise that there are cruel policies determining where they can and can't go â€” even on public land. It's time to cross out "less" once and for all.</P>
