            <p>Summary: "The term redlining came about in reference to the use of red marks on maps that loan corporations would use to outline mixed-race or African American neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods in more-affluent areas, which were deemed the most worthy of loans, were usually outlined in blue or green." -- Encyclopaedia Britannica</p>

            <P>The sole existence of property ownership propagates discrimination toward the American people based on race, ethnicity, class, and more. Redlining is still a systemic problem even though it was "banned" due to the Fair Housing Act of 1968:</P>
