            <p>Summary: "The term redlining came about in reference to the use of red marks on maps that loan corporations would use to outline mixed-race or African American neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods in more-affluent areas, which were deemed the most worthy of loans, were usually outlined in blue or green." -- Encyclopaedia Britannica</p>

            <P>The sole existence of property ownership propagates discrimination toward the American people based on race, ethnicity, class, and more. Redlining is still a systemic problem even though it was "banned" due to the Fair Housing Act of 1968:</P>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">The Mexican Border</h2>
            <p>In 2018, the Trump administration implemented the "zero tolerance policy" which entailed prosecuting all unauthorized crossings at the border --including those who are asylum seekers and those with children. This resulted in thousands of kids being separated from their parents, and were often unable to later reunite since there wasn't a system put in place to do so. Parents are detained while the children go to shelters with poor conditions such as being kept unattended in metal cages. This was a racially motivated campain since Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and "criminals". Consequently, today there are 1,703 children missing their parents and thousands more with lasting trauma. </p>
            <h3>So, did the Biden administration change anything?</h3>
            <p>Although Biden ended the zero tolerance policy and created the "Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families" executive order, families are still being separated and denied entry:</p>
